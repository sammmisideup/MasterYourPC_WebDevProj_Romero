            <h2 >COMPUTER HARDWARE</h2>
            <P>Computer hardware includes the physical components of a computer. Personal computers (PCs) are electronic
                devices that use microchips to process information and may include desktop computers, laptops or
                tablets. Since
                a computer comprises many hardware components, they work together and depend on each other to function
                properly.</p>

                <h2>Monitor</h2>
                <p>A computer monitor is an electronic device that displays what's what programs are running on your
                    computer
                    so a user can see. Some computer technicians may wear anti-static gloves when
                    handling computer monitors to avoid static electricity. They may also troubleshoot monitor issues by
                    disconnecting it from the computer and trying a new power cord.

                <h2>Mouse</h2>
                <p>A computer mouse can have a wire or is wireless and is an input device used to control a cursor
                    on the computer monitor. A wired computer mouse has a cord that connects to a USB port on a computer
                    while a wireless mouse has no physical connection with a computer system. Instead, a wireless mouse
                    communicates
                    using an adapter that is usually plugged into an available USB port and runs off its own batteries
                    using Bluetooth
                    technology. Computer technicians may troubleshoot computer mouse issues by ensuring it's connected
                    properly if it has a wire.
                    If the mouse is wireless, a technician can look to see if they need batteries and that the wireless
                    connection is working.
                    Computer technicians can clean both wired and wireless with cloths to ensure there is no dust or
                    debris on the sensor on the bottom of a mouse.
                    If there is, the mouse may not operate correctly.

                <h2>Power Supply</h2>
                <p> A power supply provides electricity to all components of a computer system. Typically, it's a power
                    cord connected from the back of a PC tower into an
                    electricity socket. A technician may troubleshoot the power supply by turning off the computer,
                    unplugging and detaching the power supply cord or trying
                    a new cord or outlet.

                <h2>Central Processing Unit</h2>
                <p> The CPU controls the computer processes and communicates with the other components of a personal
                    computer. A computer's CPU may be one of the most complicated parts
                    of the computer because of its intricacies. If a computer is experiencing CPU issues, a computer
                    technician may start by checking the fan and cleaning out any dust
                    or debris inside the machine. Another step a computer technician may complete is verifying that
                    power supply cables work. A CPU will not function properly unless it
                    receives a signal from the power supply.</p>

                <h2> Hard Drives</h2>
                <p>Hard drives are data storage devices used to store files, programs or other information on a computer
                    system. They use magnetically coated discs called hard disks that store
                    digital representations of information. If a hard drive fails, a computer technician may suspect a
                    corrupt hard drive. They may use data recovery software to repair the computer
                    or may replace the hard drive.</p>

                <p>The motherboard provides the structure for all other components and connects them, while also
                    providing a way to distribute power, deliver information and connect to devices
                    such as a printer or mouse. It controls how data transfers and what type of monitor or screen device
                    to use, for example. It houses the CPU, memory and secondary storage devices
                    such as hard drives.The first thing that a computer technician may do to troubleshoot any
                    motherboard issues is to take the PC apart and inspect all the connections for corrosion.
                    They may also check the power supply and make sure the computer is receiving electricity.</p>

                <h2>Random Access Memory</h2>
                <p>RAM is where data lives temporarily while it's being actively used by programs, such as when a user
                    launches a computer application. A technician may know how to identify the type
                    of RAM in a computer, how to replace it if it's defective and how to diagnose problems with copying
                    data from one location in memory to another.
                    A technician should have knowledge about the different RAMs that are available and they may also
                    know what types of errors might affect a computer's RAM operation. A technician may backup
                    all computer files before fixing RAM to avoid losing critical programs and documents.</p>

                <p>Cooling fans are a computer's system to decrease overheating. Many computers have more than one
                    cooling fan to help users who run their computer heavily, such as video streaming or gaming.
                    A computer technician may need to fix a computer's cooling fan if a user notices their computer
                    overheating. They may check for any damage to the blades and make sure that they are free from
                    debris. Replacing computer fans can be a common troubleshooting solution for a technician.</p>

                    Troubleshooting a VGA port could include verifying there isn't a loose connection, faulty cable or a
                    broken monitor. Another task a computer technician may do is use compressed air to spray inside the
                    VGA port to ensure it's free of dust.</p>
